# Spec Delta: Concurrency Capability

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The system SHALL provide Thread Pool Implementation

The system SHALL implement a thread pool using C++17 standard library primitives.

#### Scenario: Initialize thread pool
**Given** the application starts
**When** the thread pool is created with N worker threads
**Then** exactly N threads are spawned
**And** all threads are waiting for tasks
**And** N equals `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()` by default

#### Scenario: Submit task to thread pool
**Given** an initialized thread pool
**When** a download task is enqueued
**Then** an idle worker thread picks up the task within 100ms
**And** the task executes on the worker thread
**And** the submitting thread is not blocked

#### Scenario: Graceful shutdown
**Given** a thread pool with active tasks
**When** the shutdown is initiated
**Then** no new tasks are accepted
**And** all in-progress tasks complete before threads terminate
**And** the shutdown completes within 30 seconds or is forcibly stopped

---

### Requirement: The system SHALL provide Thread-Safe Task Queue

The system SHALL implement a thread-safe queue for download tasks.

#### Scenario: Concurrent enqueue operations
**Given** multiple threads submitting tasks
**When** tasks are enqueued simultaneously from different threads
**Then** all tasks are added to the queue without data races
**And** queue size increases correctly
**And** no tasks are lost or duplicated

#### Scenario: Concurrent dequeue operations
**Given** multiple worker threads waiting for tasks
**When** a task is enqueued
**Then** exactly one worker thread dequeues the task
**And** other threads continue waiting
**And** no task is executed by multiple workers

#### Scenario: Condition variable signaling
**Given** worker threads waiting on an empty queue
**When** a task is enqueued
**Then** at least one waiting thread is woken up
**And** the awakened thread acquires the task
**And** spurious wakeups do not cause errors

---

### Requirement: The system SHALL provide Thread Synchronization

The system SHALL use appropriate synchronization primitives for shared state.

#### Scenario: Atomic state updates
**Given** a download task with shared state (bytes downloaded, status)
**When** the worker thread updates progress
**And** the UI thread reads progress
**Then** reads always see a consistent state
**And** no torn reads or writes occur

#### Scenario: Mutex-protected operations
**Given** a download task performing a state transition (pause â†’ resume)
**When** the operation requires multiple steps
**Then** a mutex protects the entire operation
**And** other threads see either the old state or the new state, not intermediate states

#### Scenario: Deadlock prevention
**Given** multiple mutexes in the system
**When** locks must be acquired across components
**Then** locks are always acquired in a consistent order
**And** no circular wait conditions exist
**And** the system includes deadlock detection in debug builds

---

### Requirement: The system SHALL provide Resource Cleanup

The system SHALL properly manage thread resources using RAII.

#### Scenario: Exception during task execution
**Given** a worker thread executing a task
**When** the task throws an exception
**Then** the exception is caught and logged
**And** the worker thread is not terminated
**And** the thread returns to the pool ready for new tasks

#### Scenario: Application termination
**Given** active download threads
**When** the application receives a termination signal (Ctrl+C)
**Then** all threads are signaled to stop
**And** threads complete current chunks (or timeout after 5s)
**And** file handles are closed
**And** network connections are cleanly shut down

---

### Requirement: The system SHALL provide Progress Reporting Across Threads

The system SHALL safely report progress from worker threads to the UI thread.

#### Scenario: High-frequency progress updates
**Given** a download thread writing data at 10MB/s
**When** progress is updated after each chunk (256KB)
**Then** the UI thread can read progress without blocking the download thread
**And** progress reads do not require acquiring download locks
**And** progress is accurate to within one chunk size

#### Scenario: Rate-limited UI updates
**Given** progress updates occurring every 100ms
**When** the UI polls for updates at 60fps
**Then** the UI sees monotonically increasing progress
**And** no excessive locking contention occurs
**And** downloads are not slowed by UI updates

---

### Requirement: The system SHALL provide Work Distribution

The system SHALL distribute download tasks efficiently across worker threads.

#### Scenario: Balanced workload
**Given** 10 downloads of varying sizes
**When** tasks are distributed to 4 worker threads
**Then** each thread receives approximately equal work over time
**And** small files do not cause thread starvation
**And** large files do not monopolize threads

#### Scenario: Dynamic task arrival
**Given** worker threads processing downloads
**When** new downloads are added while others are in progress
**Then** idle threads immediately pick up new tasks
**And** no unnecessary delays occur
**And** the queue depth is visible for monitoring

---

## Performance Targets

- **Task enqueue latency**: < 1ms (99th percentile)
- **Worker thread wakeup latency**: < 100ms (95th percentile)
- **Lock contention**: < 5% of worker thread time spent waiting on locks
- **CPU overhead**: Thread pool consumes < 1% CPU when idle

## Cross-References

- **Enables**: `core-download` (parallel downloads)
- **Enables**: `bandwidth-control` (global throttling coordination)
- **Related to**: `terminal-ui` (thread-safe progress reading)
- **Related to**: `state-management` (concurrent state updates)

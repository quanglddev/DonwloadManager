# Spec Delta: Core Download Capability

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The system shall provide HTTP/HTTPS Download Support

The system shall download files via HTTP/HTTPS protocols using libcurl.

#### Scenario: Basic file download
**Given** a valid HTTP/HTTPS URL
**When** a download is initiated
**Then** the file is retrieved and saved to the specified destination
**And** progress is tracked (bytes downloaded, total bytes)
**And** HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx) are reported to the user

#### Scenario: HTTPS certificate validation
**Given** an HTTPS URL
**When** a download is initiated
**Then** SSL/TLS certificates are validated
**And** downloads fail with clear errors if certificates are invalid
**And** certificate validation can be optionally disabled for testing

---

### Requirement: Download Resumption

The system shall support resuming interrupted downloads using HTTP range requests.

#### Scenario: Resume after network interruption
**Given** a download in progress at 50% completion
**When** the network connection is lost
**And** the connection is restored
**Then** the download resumes from the last saved position
**And** no duplicate data is downloaded
**And** the final file is byte-for-byte identical to a fresh download

#### Scenario: Resume after application restart
**Given** a download in progress
**When** the application is closed
**And** the application is restarted
**Then** the download can be resumed from the last saved position
**And** partial file data is preserved

#### Scenario: Server does not support ranges
**Given** an HTTP server that does not advertise `Accept-Ranges` support
**When** a resume is attempted
**Then** the download restarts from the beginning
**And** the user is notified that resumption is not available

---

### Requirement: Pause and Cancel Operations

The system shall allow pausing and canceling downloads.

#### Scenario: Pause active download
**Given** a download in progress
**When** the user pauses the download
**Then** the download stops within 5 seconds
**And** partial data is saved to disk
**And** the download state is marked as "paused"

#### Scenario: Cancel active download
**Given** a download in progress
**When** the user cancels the download
**Then** the download stops immediately
**And** partial files are deleted
**And** the download is removed from the active queue

#### Scenario: Resume paused download
**Given** a paused download
**When** the user resumes the download
**Then** the download continues from the paused position
**And** progress tracking reflects the resumed state

---

### Requirement: File Integrity Verification

The system shall verify downloaded file integrity using checksums.

#### Scenario: Verify completed download with SHA-256
**Given** a download with an expected SHA-256 checksum
**When** the download completes
**Then** the file's checksum is computed
**And** the download is marked as verified if checksums match
**And** the download is marked as corrupted if checksums mismatch

#### Scenario: Handle corrupted downloads
**Given** a completed download that fails checksum verification
**When** the verification fails
**Then** the user is notified of the corruption
**And** the file is optionally moved to a quarantine directory
**And** the user can retry the download

#### Scenario: Download without checksum
**Given** a download without an expected checksum
**When** the download completes
**Then** no verification is performed
**And** the download is marked as complete

---

### Requirement: Error Handling and Retry Logic

The system shall handle network errors with automatic retry logic.

#### Scenario: Retry on transient network error
**Given** a download in progress
**When** a transient network error occurs (timeout, connection reset)
**Then** the download is retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff
**And** each retry attempt is logged
**And** the download fails if all retries are exhausted

#### Scenario: Immediate failure on permanent error
**Given** a download attempt
**When** a permanent error occurs (HTTP 404, 403)
**Then** the download fails immediately without retry
**And** the user receives a descriptive error message

#### Scenario: Disk full error
**Given** a download in progress
**When** the disk becomes full
**Then** the download is paused
**And** all active downloads are paused
**And** the user is notified to free disk space

---

### Requirement: Multiple Concurrent Downloads

The system shall download multiple files concurrently.

#### Scenario: Download multiple files simultaneously
**Given** 5 files queued for download
**When** the maximum concurrent downloads is set to 3
**Then** exactly 3 downloads are active at any time
**And** remaining downloads wait in the queue
**And** completed downloads trigger queued downloads to start

#### Scenario: Configurable concurrency limit
**Given** active downloads
**When** the user changes the concurrency limit from 3 to 5
**Then** additional downloads start immediately up to the new limit
**When** the limit is reduced from 5 to 2
**Then** no new downloads start until active count drops to 2
**And** in-progress downloads are not interrupted

- **Depends on**: `concurrency` (thread pool for parallel downloads)
- **Depends on**: `bandwidth-control` (rate limiting integration)
- **Depends on**: `state-management` (persistence for resume capability)
- **Related to**: `terminal-ui` (progress reporting)
- **Related to**: `notifications` (completion/error alerts)
